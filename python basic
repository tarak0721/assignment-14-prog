1.Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n. ?
class div_generator:
    def __init__(self,in_num):
        self.in_num = in_num
    def get_numbers(self):
        for ele in range(0,self.in_num+1):
            if ele%7 == 0:
                yield ele
                
output = div_generator(350)
for ele in output.get_numbers():
    print(ele,end=' ')
    2.Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2 3.:1 3?:1 New:1 Python:5 Read:1 and:1 between:1 choosing:1 or:2 to:1

def checkFrequency():
    in_string = input("Enter the Input String: ")
    frequency = {}
    for ele in in_string.split(" "):
        if(frequency.get(ele) == None):
            frequency[ele] = 1
        else:
            frequency[ele] += 1 
    for ele in sorted(frequency):
        print(f'{ele}:{frequency[ele]}',end=" ")
checkFrequency()
3.Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class. ?
class Person():
    def getGender():
        pass
    
class Male(Person):
    def getGender():
        print("Male")
        
class Female(Person):
    def getGender():
        print("Female")

Male.getGender()
Female.getGender()
4.Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["I", "You"] and verb is in ["Play", "Love"] and the object is in ["Hockey","Football"] ?
def generateSentences():
    subject = ['I','You']
    verb = ['Play','Love']
    object = ['Hockey','Football']
    for s in subject:
        for v in verb:
            for o in object:
                print(f'{s} {v} {o}')
                
generateSentences()
5.Please write a program to compress and decompress the string "hello world!hello world!hello world!hello world!" ?
def compress(in_string):
    output = in_string[0]
    count = 1
    for ele in range(len(in_string)-1):
        if in_string[ele] == in_string[ele+1]:
            count +=1
        else:
            if count > 1:
                output += str(count)
            output += in_string[ele+1]
            count = 1
    if count > 1:
        output += str(count)            
    print(output)


def decompress(in_string):
    output = ''
    for ele in range(len(in_string)):
        if in_string[ele].isdigit():
            output += output[-1]*(int(in_string[ele])-1)
        else:
            output += in_string[ele]
    print(output)
    
        
compress("hello world!hello world!hello world!hello world!")
decompress("hel2o world!hel2o world!hel2o world!hel2o world!")

compress('ineuron full stack datascience')
decompress('ineuron ful2 stack datascience')
